      "I don't think Sam Brownback believes he's an evil guy, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that somewhere in some time series that he has access to he had good reason to believe in his tax cuts. More specifically, that there's a case in publicly available data in which cutting top marginal income tax rates while doing nothing to offset the cut creates \"tens of thousands of new jobs\" and a huge influx of migrants to the low top tax-rate utopia. I don't know that I'll find anything, but I'll do my best.\n",
