brownback_cut
=============

Why did Sam Brownback think his tax cut would make 35,000 people move to Kansas? Why did he think it would add 23,000 jobs by 2020?

Using [IPUMS](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/) and [NBER](http://users.nber.org/~taxsim/state-rates/) data, I try to find out.

Current status: Table talked to in PgSQL! Thanks, [The Schemaverse](https://schemaverse.com/)! Next step is to aggregate and plot things, ideally with iPython notebook's handy widgets functionality.
