brownback_cut
=============

Why did Sam Brownback think his tax cut would make 35,000 people move to Kansas? Why did he think it would add 23,000 jobs by 2020?

Using [IPUMS](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/) and [NBER](http://users.nber.org/~taxsim/state-rates/) data, I try to find out.

Current status: learning enough PostgreSQL over at [The Schemaverse](https://schemaverse.com/) to use Blaze to talk to the 2.5gb datafile I created using IPUMS.
